# TakeNotes
Takenotes is a python program which takes screenshots while running in the background so you can match up the pace of the you tube video.


<> How to Use?
- download the repository and save (copy paste ) the ss.py file where you wanna store your notes.
- open terminal ( i hope you have python installed )
- pip install numpy,opencv,pyautogui,keyboard,datetime
> e.g pip install numpy

goto the location of ss.py file using: 
> cd path/of/file/ss.py

> python ss.py 
or 
> python3 ss.py 
(if you have two separate python versions)

this is basically a screen shot app running on python press "s" to take a screenshot and "q" to exit:
